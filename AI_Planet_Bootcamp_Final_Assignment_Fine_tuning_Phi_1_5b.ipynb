We will use `bitsandbytes` to [quantize the base model into 4bit](https://huggingface.co/blog/4bit-transformers-bitsandbytes). We will also install `einops` but it was mainly used for loading falcon so I will remove it in later versions."

            "## Introduction\n",
            "The goal of this chapter is to provide insights into creating custom activation functions specifically designed for deep learning models utilizing Keras library. These activation functions play crucial roles in determining whether or not certain neuron connections get activated when propagating information across different layers of a neural network. In particular, we focus on three types of activation functions namely ReLU, LeakyReLU/LRELU, and Softmax. Our discussion revolves around understanding the mathematical underpinnings behind these activation functions while leveraging Python programming concepts such as object-oriented programming, inheritance, polymorphism, decorators, and exception handling techniques like try-except blocks.\n",
            "\n",

            "## Activation Functions Class Definition\n",
            "We commence by designing a base class named \"ActivationFunction\" inherited from the parent layer class (\"Layer\"). This class contains methods related to forward propagation calculations required before applying any specific activation function. It includes basic operations including setting up variables used throughout the computation process.\n",

            "Next, let’s extend the previous class definition to include the Rectified Linear Unit (Rectifier), commonly known as ReLU.

            "Moving further ahead, consider implementing another type of activation function – leaky relus / softmax. For this purpose, we again utilize inheritance where we redefine the \"ComputeForward\" method accordingly.
